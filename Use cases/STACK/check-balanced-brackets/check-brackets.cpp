/* 
* Problem:  Check if brackets (e.g, (), [], {}) in an expression are balanced. That is, for each opening bracket exist, after it, a closing one of the same type (a bracket can only close when all brackets opened after it are closed). 
* Examples: (A + B)               ->     balanced.
            (A  * [B - 1])        ->     balanced.
            (A + B - (C / 2 + 4)] -> not balanced.
     
     
            )A + B(               -> not balanced.  (because the closing one is not after the opening one)
            [A + B * (C])         -> not balanced.  (because a bracket can only close when all brackets opened after it are closed. Last unclosed should be first closed.)
